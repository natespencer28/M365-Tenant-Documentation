## 👥 The Tenant Setup

### 🔹 Demo Users
- **Created 25 demo users** for testing and simulation.
- Bulk-created users via CSV import and onboarded them into **Entra ID**.
- Used PowerShell automation to streamline the process.

### 🔹 User Settings
- Configured **user security settings** to align with **Zero Trust principles**.  
  (e.g., MFA enforcement, limited admin privileges, secure sign-ins)

### 🔹 Custom Branding
- Implemented **custom branding** in Entra ID login pages.  
  This reduces phishing risk by helping users visually confirm legitimate login portals.

### 🔹 Dynamic Groups
- Created a **Dynamic Group** including all employee accounts for simplified management and automation.

### 🔹 Session Timeout
- Configured **idle session timeout** to **45 minutes** to reduce exposure from inactive sessions.

### 🔹 Licensing
- Established a **Group-Based Licensing Policy**:  
  - All members of the “All Company” group automatically receive **Microsoft 365 Business Premium** licenses.

### 🔹 Mock Groups
- Created **mock organizational groups** for policy scoping and testing:
  - `IT_Admins`
  - `HR_Team`
  - `Finance_Department`
  - `Executives`

### 🔹 Password Management
- **Reset all user passwords** using a PowerShell script for consistent lab access.  
- Script used: [`BulkPasswordChange.ps1`](../05_Automation/graph_api_scripts/BulkPasswordChange.ps1)  
- Documented all credentials securely for reference during testing.

> 🧠 **Note:** These configurations lay the foundation for identity hygiene, Zero Trust enforcement, and future Conditional Access and compliance testing.
